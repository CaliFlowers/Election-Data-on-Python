# Election-Data-on-Python
Aside from limited functionlity, one common issue with VBA is tht it tends to be slow as it itterates through massive datasets. 

This mini=project uses a large dataset to show that Python can effectvely handle 3.5 million rows of data relatively quickly without using bulky formulations. Python also has dictionaries and lists, a feature that allows for the containment and organization of data even without the cells in Excel. Two for-loops are used: one counts the votes cast in the election; while the other determines the winner of the electionfrom the list of candidates who received votes
 These results are then exported to a .txt file, whch allows for the saving of the output, without the tools in Microsoft office.
 
 In this hypithetical case, the winner, Mr. Khan, received 2.2 million out of 3.5 million votes cast. This relatively simple kind of code could be useful for ballot tabulation machines; or automating any tedious counting task that might otherwise require dozens of people hours to perform.
