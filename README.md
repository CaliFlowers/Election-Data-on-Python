# Election-Data-on-Python
Aside from limited functionlity, one common issue with VBA is tht it tends to be slow as it itterates through massive datasets. 

This mini=project uses a large dataset to show that Python can effectvely handle 700,000 + rows of data relatively quickly without using bulky if/then  
statements. Python also has doctionaries and lists, a feature that allows for the efficient containment and organization for data even without the cells in Excel. Two for-loops are used: one counts the votes cast in the election and; while the other determines the winner of the electionfrom the list of candidates who received votes
 These results are then exported to a .txt file, whch allows for the saving of the output, without the tools in Microsoft office.
